![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/The_game_maker_logo.png/220px-The_game_maker_logo.png)

As the name would suggest, GameMaker Studio is a game engine. You can program 2D games using "Game Maker Language", although GameMaker Studio also features a drag and drop system that can be used instead. This makes it more accessible for beginners.

# What is the difference between GameMaker Studio and GameMaker Studio 2?

* GameMaker Studio has a free version available. GameMaker Studio 2, however, currently has no free version, although the price does differ depending on the version being purchased. The cheapest version of GameMaker Studio 2 is approximately $40 and has a 12-month license, the standard version is $100, and the most expensive version is $400 with the ability to publish to consoles.
* GameMaker Studio 2 is able to export games to newer consoles, with plans to add Nintendo Switch support in the near future.

# How do you get it?

It can be downloaded [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmstudio/?source=directory).
GameMaker Studio used to also be available on the Steam store, but it has since been removed in favor of GameMaker Studio 2.

## How to add sprites

1. Click on the Resources tab at the top.
2. Select "Create Sprite".
3. Clicking "Load Sprite" will let you import a pre-existing .png image, while "Edit Sprite" will open an image editor that lets you draw your own sprite from scratch (or make changes to what you already have).

## How to add sounds

1. Click on the Resources tab at the top.
2. Select "Create Sound".
3. Like with sprites, you can choose to import and existing sound file if you wish.

## How to add backgrounds

1. Click on the Resources tab at the top.
2. Select "Create Background".
3. Once again, you can import an image or use the built-in image editor to create one.
4. Background images can consist of various tiles, or squares that can be pieced together in different combinations to create a more complex and coherent background. Doing it this way uses less processing power.

## How to use scripts

1. Click on the Resources tab at the top.
2. Select "Create Script".
3. A window will open. Here, you can write your code for the script. Scripts in GameMaker are written in Game Maker Language, which actually has a number of similarities to other programming languages such as JavaScript.
